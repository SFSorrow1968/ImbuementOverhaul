# Agent Instructions

When making changes in this repo:
- Always build `Release` and `Nomad` before finalizing.
- Keep changes aligned with the current folder structure (`Configuration`, `Core`, `Hooks`, `_agent`, `_docs`).
- Use local references in `References/` and local tooling in `../.tools/` to decompile `../libs/*.dll` when API behavior is unclear.
- Build artifacts are expected in `bin/Release/PCVR/EnemyImbuePresets/` and `bin/Release/Nomad/EnemyImbuePresets/`.
- Treat `QUIRKS.md` as an index of theme-specific quirk logs, not a single catch-all file.
- Before deep refactors or debugging sessions, review `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `QUIRKS.md`, and the relevant `<THEME>QUIRKS.md` files.
- Add non-obvious findings to a specifically named quirk file such as `IMBUESQUIRKS.md`, `UIQUIRKS.md`, or `TOOLINGQUIRKS.md`.
- If a themed quirk file does not exist yet, create it with Issue/Context/Solution entries and add it to `QUIRKS.md`.
- If the user asks for a new project, scaffold a similar project structure plus build and git workflows, then tailor `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and themed quirk files to that project's domain.
- Use a feature branch for every task (for example `agent/<topic>`), and avoid direct work on `main`/`master`.
- End each substantial task update with a merge reminder that names the active feature branch and target branch.
- Follow `_docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for branch naming, validation, and merge cadence.
